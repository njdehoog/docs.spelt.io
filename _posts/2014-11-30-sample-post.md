This guide is here to help you get started using Spelt. It covers topics such as starting a new project, creating and editing your content, customizing the look of your site and publishing your blog to the world.

## So what is Spelt exactly?

Spelt is a __static site generator__ geared towards blogs. It takes your [Markdown](/markdown/) formatted blog posts and based on some template files it converts those into a ready-to-publish static website. Spelt also allows you to publish the resulting website directly to Amazon S3. You can read more about this in the [publishing guide](/amazon/).

## That sounds great! How do I get started?
